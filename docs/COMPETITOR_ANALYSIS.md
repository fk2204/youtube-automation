## 4. Cross-Niche Best Practices

### The IMPACT Title Formula
- **I** - Immediate Hook (First 3-5 words)
- **M** - Measurable Outcome (Numbers/results)
- **P** - Personal or Proof Element (Credibility)
- **A** - Audience Clarification (Who it's for)
- **C** - Curiosity or Controversy (Intrigue)
- **T** - Timeframe (When/urgency)

### Psychological Triggers for CTR
1. **Curiosity Gap**: Create tension between what viewer knows and wants to know
2. **Loss Aversion**: "You're losing $X" > "You could gain $X"
3. **Social Proof**: Reference authorities, statistics, studies
4. **Specificity**: "73.2% of people" not "most people"

### Retention Optimization

#### First 30 Seconds Structure
| Timing | Element | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 0-5s | Pattern interrupt/bold claim | Grab attention (critical for 70%+ retention) |
| 5-15s | Context + first open loop | Set stakes, plant curiosity |
| 15-30s | First micro-payoff | Deliver value, prevent drop-off |

#### Engagement Techniques
- **Open Loops**: Minimum 3 per video (32% increase in watch time)
- **Micro-cliffhangers**: Every 45-60 seconds
- **Direct Address**: Use "you" at least 3 times per minute
- **Rhetorical Questions**: Every 30-45 seconds
- **Specific Numbers**: Always use exact figures

#### CTA Placement (Strategic)
| Position | Timing | Type |
|----------|--------|------|
| NEVER | First 30 seconds | (kills retention) |
| Soft | 30% mark | "If you're finding this valuable, hit subscribe..." |
| Engagement | 50% mark | "Comment below with your experience..." |
| Final | 95% mark | "Like and subscribe for more..." |
